# Cash-Register-app


Welcome to my profilio! I make this cash-register app by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS learned from neog.camp.
This will help the user by telling how they return the change to customer with mininum number of notes. 

The below text is to explain my project detials.

Problem Statement:
Your program has currencies of Rs. 1, 5, 10, 20, 100, 500, 2000.
Your user enters a bill amount say Rs. 243.
Your user then enters cash given say Rs. 2000.
Now, help the user by telling how can he/she return the change to the customer with a minimum number of notes?

This app built with VanillaJS by using Visual Studio Code.
First, create three seperate file for app.js, html file, and style file.

In program,

Step-1: create input for bill amount and cash given.
Step-2: create table for return change.
Step-3: using qureySelector to call a input.
Step-4: add event listerner.
Step-5: check:
          amountToBeReturened = cashGiven - billamount
Step-6: Loop:
          number of notes = Math.trunc( amountToBeReturened / numberOfNotes.
Step-7:Display output
